### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a backend software engineer with 4+ years of experience designing scalable systems and real-time APIs.  
My work focuses on building resilient architectures, modular codebases, and developer-friendly APIs — especially in crypto payment infrastructures.

Currently, I’m leading backend development at a blockchain-focused company,  
building a secure, scalable crypto gateway with multi-chain support.
